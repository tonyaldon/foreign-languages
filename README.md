# About

`foreign-languages` pools some of the documents I've been using to
learn foreign languages (other than french). 

Up to now, the main documents are two anki decks that I'm using with the very effective
application <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki<a>.


# Anki

When you want to learn a foreign language, but now you can't live in the country,
to start as soon as possible, a good idea could be to learn the basic
vocabulary and some basic phrases from scratch. And for that kind of things, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki<a> is
a powerfull tool.

Indeed, Anki allows you to remember everythings using intelligent flash cards.

# Anki decks

Here, I share two decks I've been using in order to learn English and
Spanish. I've made them from french books of the well know
series <a href="https://bescherelle.com/">Bescherelle<a>:
1. <a
href="https://bescherelle.com/bescherelle-poche-espagnol-9782218938337">Bescherelle
Poche Espagnol<a>
2. <a
href="https://bescherelle.com/bescherelle-poche-anglais-9782218938320">Bescherelle
Poche Anglais<a>

These two decks are also available directly at <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">anki shared deck<a> page:
